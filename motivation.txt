SHARPEN YOUR AXE:
John, a woodcutter, worked for a company for five years but never got a raise. The
company hired Bill and within a year he got a raise. This caused resentment in John and
he went to his boss to talk about it. The boss said, "You are still cutting the same number
of trees you were cutting five years ago. We are a result-oriented company and would be
happy to give you a raise if your productivity goes up." John went back, started hitting
harder and putting in longer hours but he still wasn't able to cut more trees. He went back
to his boss and told him his dilemma. The boss told John to go talk to Bill. "Maybe there
is something Bill knows that you and l don't." John asked Bill how he managed to cut
more trees. Bill answered, "After every tree l cut, l take a break for two minutes and
sharpen my axe. When was the last time you sharpened your axe?" This question hit
home like a bullet and John got his answer.

My question is, when was the last time you sharpened your axe? Past glory and
education don't do it. We have to continuously sharpen the axe.
